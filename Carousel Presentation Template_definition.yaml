  notes: "To progress to the level of a frontier-first organization, companies need\
    \ to overcome some common challenges. They can do this by leveraging the power\
    \ of AI. \n\nApps aren't just for data entry—they're living storyboards of work.\
    \ They will continue to exist as our human interface with systems and processes.\
    \ Apps are also the space in which we collaborate with agents.\n\nAgents aren't\
    \ just assistants, they're autonomous collaborators. Together, with apps, they\
    \ transform business processes at enterprise scale by driving actions and results\
    \ with automation.\n\nApps combined with intelligent agents empower IT makers\
    \ by accelerating development and enhancing control. \n\nPower apps gives IT teams\
    \ the tools they need to build tailored apps. Infusing those apps with intelligent\
    \ agents that automate and extend their functionality helps you move from reactive\
    \ to proactive.\n\nYou could build agents anywhere, but only Power Platform plus\
    \ Copilot Studio lets you build, govern, and scale them with the same tools and\
    \ teams that you already trust. \n\nAnd with Microsoft 365 Copilot, every employee’s\
    \ work is grounded in their own work content—like emails, meetings, and documents—so\
    \ they can move faster, make smarter decisions, and stay focused on what matters\
    \ most.\n"

  notes: "Microsoft Copilot Studio helps you accelerate productivity with agent-powered\
    \ business processes. \n\nMicrosoft Copilot Studio enables businesses to create\
    \ custom copilots using generative AI. The solution democratizes rapid app creation.\
    \  It integrates seamlessly with Microsoft technologies like Azure AI Studio,\
    \ ensuring a smooth experience. It integrates and exposes various Microsoft’s\
    \ conversational AI technology stacks - integrated with Azure AI Studio, Azure\
    \ Cognitive Services, Azure Bot Framework, Power Platforms AI models, and more.\n\
     \nThe platform also offers governance and control, allowing organizations to\
    \ manage customizations, monitor usage, and maintain security and compliance.\n\
     \nWith Copilot Studio, development starts with a prompt, not permissions. You\
    \ can start with a pre-built agent or create your own using natural language and\
    \ generative AI. \n\vYour agents can reason over data, retrieve insights, and\
    \ orchestrate complex workflows across systems. With custom agents, answer questions\
    \ and complete tasks for individuals, teams, and functions. Agents are AI-powered\
    \ assistants that autonomously automate processes, freeing employees to focus\
    \ on strategic work.\n \nWith Copilot Studio, you can:\nDesign copilots from the\
    \ ground up using generative AI and low-code tools and define exactly what your\
    \ copilot should do, including how it responds, what data it accesses, and how\
    \ it integrates with your systems. Connections to internal and external data sources\
    \ can use pre-built or custom plugins.\nExtend Microsoft 365 Copilot with your\
    \ own enterprise data, workflows, and connectors—ensuring the AI aligns with your\
    \ business context\nDeploy across multiple channels, including Microsoft Teams,\
    \ websites, and even Facebook. This makes it possible to embed AI into your existing\
    \ digital ecosystem. You can turn your copilot into a central interface for business\
    \ processes—from HR and IT support to customer service and sales.\n\n\n"

  notes: "Let’s talk about Microsoft 365 Copilot—the unified AI-experience for work.\
    \ It’s not just another productivity tool, it’s productivity, reimagined\n\vMicrosoft\
    \ Copilot 365 is an AI-first solution that brings together everything you need\
    \ in a seamless experience. Chat, Search, Agents, Notebooks, and Create—all in\
    \ one place. It’s , designed to meet people where they work, and to help them\
    \ meet the needs of modern work by helping them work faster, think bigger, and\
    \ stay focused.\n\nWhat really sets it apart is how it grounds every employee’s\
    \ work in their own work content—like emails, meetings, and documents. That means\
    \ Copilot isn’t guessing—it’s working with the same context you are, so it can\
    \ deliver insights and actions that are actually relevant.\n\nCopilot also helps\
    \ you build a trusted ecosystem of agents. You can design and deploy agents with\
    \ a consistent UI and standardized controls and manage your agents at-scale through\
    \ the Agent Store. It’s governance and flexibility, built in.\n\nAgents aren’t\
    \ just assistants, they think and act like employees. Whether it’s a research\
    \ agent, an analyst, or something custom-built, they use deep reasoning to collaborate,\
    \ automate, and drive real outcomes.\n\n\n"

  notes: "Let’s walk through what it really means to implement AI at scale—and do\
    \ it with confidence. This isn’t just about building smart tools. It’s about making\
    \ sure they’re secure, governed, efficient, and measurable.\n\nSecure Execution:\
    \ First up—secure execution. We want to make sure our AI agents are running safely.\
    \ That means embedding business logic directly into how they operate, so they\
    \ follow the rules. And we’re putting safeguards in place to prevent data leaks\
    \ or insider threats. It’s about building trust into the system from the start.\
    \ We’re keeping AI secure, compliant, and manageable—without putting extra burdens\
    \ on makers.\n\nAll data used by agents—whether it’s from Microsoft 365, connected\
    \ systems, or unstructured sources—is protected by the same security standards\
    \ as Office apps. Thanks to Dataverse, things like MIP labels and compliance rules\
    \ are applied automatically, based on who or what is running the workflow.\n\n\
    Security teams get real-time insights through Microsoft Purview—like spotting\
    \ oversharing or sensitive data risks—without makers needing to lift a finger.\
    \ Once Purview is enabled, agents inherit all the right protections. We’re also\
    \ tackling AI-specific threats. Defender for Cloud Apps will soon help us catch\
    \ things like prompt injection attacks as they happen.\n\nAnd agent identities?\
    \ Fully managed by Entra. Makers don’t need to do anything extra. It’s a seamless\
    \ way to scale AI agents securely across teams and processes.\n\nGovern Usage:\
    \ Next is governance. Policies aren’t just written—they’re codified. That way,\
    \ every agent and app behaves ethically and consistently, by default. It’s how\
    \ we make sure AI aligns with our values and compliance standards.\n\nManaging\
    \ the full lifecycle of AI-agents—sharing, blocking, and scaling—is done by using\
    \ zoned governance. This helps ensure agent skills grow in a secure, controlled\
    \ way. Agents and environments can be tailored to fit business needs, using connector\
    \ policies that balance innovation with control. \n\nThere’s also flexibility\
    \ with Copilot licensing. Convert usage into M365 Copilot seats, apply prepaid\
    \ message packs across environments, and use Pay-as-you-go to drive adoption in\
    \ new areas. And track usage for cross-charging and budgeting\n\nOperate Efficiently:\
    \ Then there’s scale. We want to manage and optimize all our AI apps and agents\
    \ from one secure control point. That gives us consistency, precision, and the\
    \ ability to move fast—without losing control.\n\nMonitor Performance: And finally,\
    \ we need to measure what matters. We’re tracking AI impact and KPIs in real time.\
    \ Performance analytics help us spot trends, guide improvements, and make smarter\
    \ decisions going forward. \n\nUnderstand agent usage and consumption throughout\
    \ your tenant.  Identify your top agents, see agent usage by groups and identify\
    \ areas of opportunities to drive further adoption.\n\nMonitor productivity changes\
    \ and time savings in your org and account for how Copilot adoption is enhancing\
    \ your digital transformation.\n\nUnderstand the business impact of agents with\
    \ the ability to bring in your business metrics and see how they relate to agent\
    \ usage so you can measure business value and ROI.  \n\nSo when we say ‘AI operationalization\
    \ done right,’ we mean secure by design, integrated by default—and built to scale\
    \ with confidence. Now it’s easier than ever to unify and operationalize knowledge\
    \ across your Microsoft agent ecosystem.\n"
